################ Regular Expression ################
# Regular Expression is used to clean the data using patterns
import re  # Import the 're' module for regular expressions

# Search for the pattern "cat" in the given string
x = re.search("cat", "A cat and a rat can't be friends.")
print(x)  # Print the result of the search operation

# Search for the pattern "cow" in the given string
x = re.search("cow", "A cat and a rat can't be friends.")
print(x)  # Print the result of the search operation

# In the previous example we had to import the module re to be able to work 
# with regular expressions. 
# Then we used the method search from the re module. This is most probably the most important 
# and the most often used method of this module. re.search(expr,s) checks a string s 
# for an occurrence of a substring which matches the regular expression expr. 


# Let's assume that we have not been interested in the previous example to 
# recognize the word cat, but all three letter words, which end with "at". 
# The syntax of regular expressions supplies a metacharacter ".", 
# which is used like a placeholder for "any character".
# Here dot is placeholder which means any character can come.
r" .at "
# we are finding the word pattern 'at' by using the search function
x = re.search(r" .at ", "A cat and a rat can't be friends.")
# printing the variable x
print(x)
# This regular expression matches three letter words, isolated by blanks, which end in "at".
# Now we get words like "rat", "cat", "bat", "eat", "sat" and many others.

# But what if the text contains "words" like "@at" or "3at"?

# Square brackets, "[" and "]", are used to include a character class. 
# [xyz] means e.g. either an "x", an "y" or a "z".

r"M[ae][iy]er" 
# Maier,Mayer,Meier,Meyer
# This is a regular expression, which matches a surname with four different 
# spellings: Maier, Mayer, Meier, Meyer.

# We might need e.g. a class of letters between "a" and "e" or between "0" and "5". 
# To manage such character classes, the syntax of regular expressions supplies
# a metacharacter "-". 
# [a-e] a simplified writing for [abcde] or [0-5] denotes [012345].
# [ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ] we can write [A-Z].
# "any lower case or uppercase letter" [A-Za-z]
# Another Metacharacter is "^" which can be used inside square brackets
# If it is used directly after an opening sqare bracket, it negates the choice.
# If it is not positioned as the first character following the opening square 
# bracket, it has no special meaning. 
# Similarly "-" also if positioned at first means match with "-".

import re  # Import the 're' module for regular expressions

# Define the input text
txt = "The rain in Spain"

# Use re.findall() to find all occurrences of the pattern "ai" in the text
x = re.findall("ai", txt)

# Print the result
print(x)

# The special sequences consist of "\\" and a character from the following list:
# \d  Matches any decimal digit; equivalent to the set [0-9].
# \D  is not of \d. It matches any non-digit character; equivalent to the set [^0-9].
# \s  Matches any whitespace character; equivalent to [ \t\n\r\f\v].
# \S  The complement of \s. It matches any non-whitespace character; equiv. to [^ \t\n\r\f\v].
# \w  Matches any alphanumeric character; equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_]. With LOCALE, it will match the set [a-zA-Z0-9_] plus characters defined as letters for the current locale.
# \W  Matches the complement of \w.
# \b  Matches the empty string, but only at the start or end of a word.
# \B  Matches the empty string, but not at the start or end of a word.
# \\  Matches a literal backslash.


# Quantifiers
# A quantifier after a token, which can be a single character or group in brackets
# Specifies how often that preceding element is allowed to occur. 
# The most common quantifiers are the question mark (?).
# The asterisk or star character *, and the plus sign +.

################ re.sub function ################
# Python regex sub() function that returns a string after replacing the matched 
# pattern in a string with a replacement.

# Introduction to the Python regex sub function
# The sub() is a function in the built-in re module that handles regular expressions. 
# The sub() function has the following syntax:

# re.sub(pattern, repl, string, count = 0, flags = 0)
# Code language: Python

# In this syntax:
# pattern is a regular expression that you want to match. Besides a regular 
# expression, the pattern can be Pattern object.
# repl is the replacement
# string is the input string
# count parameter specifies the maximum number of matches that the sub() function 
# should replace. If you pass zero to the count parameter or completely skip 
# it, the sub() function will replace all the matches.
# flags is one or more regex flags that modify the standard behavior of the pattern.
# The sub() function searches for the pattern in the string and replaces the 
# matched strings with the replacement (repl).

# If the sub() function couldn’t find a match, it returns the original string. 
# Otherwise, the sub() function returns the string after replacing the matches.

# Note that the sub() function replaces the leftmost non-overlapping occurrences 
# of the pattern. And you’ll see it in detail in the following example.

# Python regex sub function examples
# Let’s take some examples of using the regex sub() function.

# 1) Using the regex sub() function to return the plain phone number
# The following example uses the sub() function to turn the phone number (212)-456-7890 into 2124567890 :

## Number

import re

randstr = "12345"

# Count the number of digits in the string using regular expression
print(len(re.findall("\d", randstr)))  # Print the count of digits in the string

# Search for the first digit in the string using regular expression
print(re.search("\d{1}", randstr))  # Print the first digit found in the string

## Pan number verification 

import re

# Define a PAN number string
pan = "4669-5495-AA1212hhwjjwkq3"

# Check if the PAN number matches the specified pattern
if re.search("\d{4}-\d{4}-\w{15}", pan):
    print("it is a Pan No.")  # Print a message indicating that it is a PAN number
else:
    print("its not a Pan No.")  # Print a message indicating that it is not a PAN number

import re

# Define a string containing a name
name = "My name is Yashvi, you tell me what is your name"

# Split the string into a list of words using space as the delimiter
re.split(" ", name)  # Split the string using space as the delimiter and print the list of words


import re

# Define a string
string = "Python programming is fun"

# Check if 'Python' is at the beginning of the string
match = re.search('\APython', string)

if match:
    print("pattern found inside the string")  # Print if the pattern is found
else:
    print("pattern not found")  # Print if the pattern is not found

# Output: pattern found inside the string

import re

# Define a text string
txt = "The rain in Spain"

# Search for a pattern that starts with 'The', followed by any characters (.*), and ends with 'Spain'
x = re.search("^The.*Spain$", txt)

if x:
    print("YES! We have a match!")  # Print if a match is found
else:
    print("No match")  # Print if no match is found
